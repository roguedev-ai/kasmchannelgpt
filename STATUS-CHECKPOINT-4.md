# Build Process Checkpoint

## Build Status
✅ Build completed successfully
⚠️ Non-critical warnings present
❌ Qdrant health check failed (expected in mock mode)

## Build Statistics
- First Load JS shared by all: 87.4 kB
- Middleware size: 26.5 kB
- Total routes: 19
- Static pages: 15
- Dynamic routes: 4

## Warnings Summary

### ESLint Warnings
1. Image Optimization (16 instances)
   - Using `<img>` instead of `next/image`
   - Impact: Potential slower LCP and higher bandwidth
   - Non-critical for local development

2. React Hook Dependencies (20 instances)
   - Missing dependencies in useEffect/useCallback hooks
   - Impact: Potential React lifecycle issues
   - Non-critical for mock environment testing

3. Accessibility (4 instances)
   - Missing alt text on images
   - Impact: Accessibility concerns
   - Non-critical for mock testing

## Critical Errors
1. Qdrant Health Check
   ```
   [Health] Error: Error: Qdrant health check failed
   ```
   - Expected behavior in mock mode
   - Qdrant service intentionally not running
   - Mock data will be used instead

2. Server Version Check
   ```
   Failed to obtain server version. Unable to check client-server compatibility.
   ```
   - Expected in mock mode
   - No impact on local development

## Status
✅ Build process completed
✅ All pages generated successfully
✅ Mock mode configuration working
⚠️ Expected errors from mock services present

## Next Steps
1. Start development server
2. Test mock endpoints
3. Verify UI functionality
4. Document any runtime issues

## Notes
- All build errors are expected due to mock configuration
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- React warnings can be addressed later if needed
- Build optimization successful
